This is a python module to deal with rotations.

There are many ways to represent and apply rotations. I have my favorite, but
I often have to work with others. This is my effort to simplify translating
between representations and provide a few fairly efficient tools for applying
rotations to arbitrary data. 

This is intended to work primarily with numpy, but I would be open to more 
general implementation and packaging.

ps- This is also my first git repo, so I'm using it to learn that system 
    as well.
